## Que 15: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.
ans. In programming, functions utilize parameters to accept input data, and return values to send results back to the caller. Parameters are variables defined within the function's parentheses, acting as placeholders for the values passed when the function is called. Return values, specified with the return keyword, are sent back to the code that invoked the function, potentially used in further calculations or operations. 

#### Parameters:

Purpose: 
Parameters allow functions to be versatile and adaptable, as they can operate on different input values each time they are called.

Definition:
 Parameters are declared within the parentheses of a function definition.

Example: 
In the function def add_numbers(x, y):, x and y are parameters.

Arguments:
 When the function is called, the values passed in are called arguments (e.g., add_numbers(5, 3)). 

#### Return Values:

Purpose:
Return values allow functions to produce a result that can be used elsewhere in the program.

return keyword:
The return statement is used to specify the value that the function will output. 

Example:
In the add_numbers function, return x + y would send the sum of x and y back to the caller.

Void Functions:
Functions that don't have a return statement are often called void functions and may perform actions like printing to the console, modifying variables, or interacting with external systems, rather than returning a specific value. 

Optional:
Not all functions need to return a value. Some functions might perform actions without needing to send a result back.
