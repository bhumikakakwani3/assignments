## Que 9: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work with an example.
ans. Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which statements are executed within a program. By default, code runs sequentially from top to bottom. However, control flow statements like conditionals (if-else), loops (for, while), and functions allow for altering this default execution order, enabling programs to make decisions, repeat actions, or execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions.

##### How if-else statements work:
The if-else statement is a fundamental control flow construct used for conditional execution. It allows a program to execute one block of code if a specified condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false.
###### `if` statement:
The if statement evaluates a condition provided in parentheses (). If this condition evaluates to true, the code block immediately following the if statement (enclosed in curly braces {}) is executed.
###### `else` statement:
The else statement is optional and provides an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition in the preceding if statement evaluates to false.
