## Que.1 What are the additional tags used in HTML5?

ans.`<article>` This new sectioning element is used to mark specific content as being part of an article.

    
`<audio>`
This element allows users to embed a page’s sound content, such as music or audio streams. The `<audio>` tag is used with one or more `<source>` tags to demarcate audio sources. The browser will run the first supported source. Supported audio formats include MP3, OGG, and WAV. If a browser does not support this element, it will display the text between the `<audio>` and `</audio>` tags.

`<canvas>`

This element uses JavaScript to draw graphics (boxes, paths, gradients, text) and add images to a page. Borders and text are not included by default, and the tags are transparent and only serve as a container for drawn graphics. These graphics can be generated using a script distinct from the element. If the element is not supported or JavaScript is disabled in a browser, it will show any text inside the `<canvas>` tags.

 `<data>`

This element is used to add machine-readable information to content. The machine-readable value is provided by data processors, while a human-readable value is also offered for web browsers to render.

`<datalist>`

This element provides an ‘autocomplete’ feature for the `<input>` element by specifying a dropdown list of preset options that the browser will present to users as data is inputted. The id attribute of the `<datalist>` element has to be equal to the list attribute of the `<input>`element to bind them.
