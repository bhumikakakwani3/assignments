## Que 7: Describe the properties justify-content, align-items, and flexdirection used in Flexbox.

Ans.
#### Flexbox Properties:
`flex-wrap`: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines.
 `flex-flow`: Shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap .
  `justify-content`: Aligns items along the main axis.
   `align-content`: Aligns items along the cross axis.

   ##### justify-content:

   justify-content is a CSS property that is used to align and distribute the flex items (or content) along the main axis of a flex container. It controls the horizontal alignment of items within a flex container.

   ##### Align-items:

   Vertical alignment is known as the vertical-align property in CSS. With this, we can set the vertical alignment of the content of `<th>` and `<td>` tags as top, bottom, and middle. Note: Default values of table head and table data contents are middle aligned.


   In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite of flex-direction).

   In a grid container, the grid items are aligned in the block direction.


##### flex-direction:
The flex-direction property in CSS is used to set the direction of the flex container's main axis. It can have one of four values:<b> row , row-reverse , column , or column-reverse </b>. row is the default value and arranges flex items horizontally.
