## Que 8: Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox?

Ans.   CSS Grid provides two-dimensional layout capabilities, allowing for elements to be arranged horizontally and vertically. On the other hand, CSS Flexbox provides flexibility, allowing for elements to be placed on a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.

   when you need to create a two-dimensional layout, meaning you want to control the positioning of elements across both rows and columns      simultaneously, like in a complex grid structure for a magazine layout or a responsive webpage with multiple content areas that need precise placement within a grid system. 

 #### When to choose Grid:

##### Complex layouts with multiple content areas:

When you need to place elements in different positions across rows and columns, like a website with a sidebar, main content area, and footer.

##### Responsive grid structures:
Grid allows for easy creation of responsive grids where elements can adjust their position based on screen size. 

##### Precise element placement:
If you need to define exact row and column spans for each element within your layout.
