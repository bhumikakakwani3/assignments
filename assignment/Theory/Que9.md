## Que. 9: What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide examples.

Ans.In HTML tables, the colspan attribute merges cells horizontally, while the rowspan attribute merges cells vertically. Both are attributes of the `<td>` or `<th>` tags. 

- Explanation:

###### Colspan
Merges cells horizontally, allowing a single cell to span multiple columns. When using colspan, the cells in the subsequent columns are moved to the right. For example, `<td colspan="2">`Merged Cell`</td>` combines two columns. 

###### Rowspan

Merges cells vertically, allowing a single cell to span multiple rows. For example, `<TD Rowspan = "3">` spans three rows. 

  - You can use colspan and rowspan together to create more complex table layouts.
