## Que. 8: Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following elements: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, and `<thead>`.

Ans. An HTML table is made up of rows and columns of cells, organized using the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, and `<thead>` tags. The `<thead>` tag defines the table's header section, which contains information about the table's columns.
